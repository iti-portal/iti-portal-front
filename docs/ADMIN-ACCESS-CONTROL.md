# Admin Access Control Implementation

## Overview
This implementation ensures that only users with admin role can access admin dashboard and related admin functionality.

## Components Created/Modified

### 1. RoleBasedRoute Component (`src/routes/RoleBasedRoute.jsx`)
- **Purpose**: A flexible route protection component that can be used for any role-based access control
- **Features**:
  - Checks authentication status
  - Validates user roles using either hierarchical permissions or allowed roles list
  - Redirects to `/unauthorized` if access is denied
  - Redirects to `/login` if not authenticated

### 2. AdminRoute Component (`src/routes/AdminRoute.jsx`)
- **Purpose**: Specific protection for admin-only routes
- **Features**:
  - Checks if user is authenticated
  - Validates admin role specifically
  - Shows loading spinner during authentication check
  - Redirects unauthorized users to `/unauthorized`

### 3. Unauthorized Page (`src/pages/Unauthorized.jsx`)
- **Purpose**: User-friendly page shown when access is denied
- **Features**:
  - Clear error message explaining access denial
  - Shows current user role for clarity
  - Provides navigation options (Go Back, Go to Home)
  - Contact information for support

### 4. usePermissions Hook (`src/hooks/usePermissions.js`)
- **Purpose**: Centralized permission checking throughout the application
- **Features**:
  - Role-specific check functions (isAdmin, isStudent, etc.)
  - Hierarchical permission checking
  - Easy-to-use interface for components

## Route Protection

### Admin Routes Protected:
- `/admin/dashboard` - Admin Dashboard
- `/admin/staff` - Staff Management
- `/admin/users` - User Management  
- `/admin/services` - Service Management

### Implementation in AppRoutes.jsx:
```jsx
<Route 
  path="/admin/dashboard" 
  element={
    <RoleBasedRoute allowedRoles={[USER_ROLES.ADMIN]}>
      <AdminDashboardPage />
    </RoleBasedRoute>
  } 
/>
```

## Navigation Protection

### Navbar Updates (`src/components/Layout/Navbar.jsx`)
- Admin navigation links are conditionally rendered
- Only visible when `user?.role === USER_ROLES.ADMIN`
- Applied to both desktop and mobile navigation

### Before (Visible to all users):
```jsx
<Link to="/admin" className={getLinkClasses('/admin')}>Admin</Link>
```

### After (Visible only to admin users):
```jsx
{user?.role === USER_ROLES.ADMIN && (
  <Link to="/admin/dashboard" className={getLinkClasses('/admin')}>Admin</Link>
)}
```

## Security Layers

### 1. Route Level Protection
- All admin routes wrapped with `RoleBasedRoute`
- Checks authentication and role before rendering components
- Redirects unauthorized access attempts

### 2. Navigation Level Protection
- Admin navigation links only visible to admin users
- Prevents users from seeing admin options they can't access

### 3. Component Level Protection (Optional)
- `usePermissions` hook can be used within components for additional checks
- Example usage:
```jsx
const { canAccessAdmin } = usePermissions();

return (
  <div>
    {canAccessAdmin() && (
      <AdminOnlyComponent />
    )}
  </div>
);
```

## User Experience

### For Non-Admin Users:
1. Admin navigation links are hidden
2. Direct URL access to admin routes redirects to `/unauthorized`
3. Clear feedback about why access was denied
4. Easy navigation back to accessible areas

### For Admin Users:
1. Normal access to all admin functionality
2. Admin navigation links visible and functional
3. Seamless experience with proper role recognition

## Role Hierarchy

Based on `authHelpers.js`, the role hierarchy is:
1. **admin** (level 5) - Highest privileges
2. **staff** (level 4)
3. **company** (level 3)
4. **alumni** (level 2)
5. **student** (level 1) - Lowest privileges

## Testing Access Control

### Test Cases:
1. **Admin User**: Should see admin navigation and access all admin routes
2. **Non-Admin User**: Should not see admin navigation, redirected if accessing admin URLs
3. **Unauthenticated User**: Redirected to login when accessing any admin route
4. **Direct URL Access**: All admin URLs should be protected regardless of how accessed

### Manual Testing:
1. Login as admin user → Should see admin navigation and access admin dashboard
2. Login as non-admin user → Should not see admin navigation
3. Try accessing `/admin/dashboard` directly as non-admin → Should redirect to `/unauthorized`
4. Access admin route while logged out → Should redirect to `/login`

## Future Enhancements

### Recommended Additions:
1. **Audit Logging**: Log all admin access attempts
2. **Session Timeout**: Enhanced security for admin sessions
3. **Two-Factor Authentication**: Additional security for admin accounts
4. **Permission Granularity**: More specific permissions within admin role
5. **Admin Activity Monitoring**: Track admin actions for security

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files:
- `src/routes/AdminRoute.jsx`
- `src/routes/RoleBasedRoute.jsx`
- `src/pages/Unauthorized.jsx`
- `src/hooks/usePermissions.js`

### Modified Files:
- `src/routes/AppRoutes.jsx` - Added route protection
- `src/components/Layout/Navbar.jsx` - Added conditional navigation

## Security Notes

1. **Client-Side Protection**: This implementation provides UI-level protection but should be coupled with server-side validation
2. **Token Validation**: Ensure backend APIs also validate user roles and permissions
3. **Role Verification**: User role should be verified on each API request, not just stored in localStorage
4. **Route Guards**: All sensitive routes are protected at the routing level
5. **Navigation Security**: UI elements are conditionally rendered based on user permissions
