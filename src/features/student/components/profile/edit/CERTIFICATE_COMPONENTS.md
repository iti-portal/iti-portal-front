# Certificate Components Documentation

## Overview
The Certificates & Awards section has been refactored into modular components following the same pattern as the Education and Experience sections.

## Components

### CertificateSection.jsx
- **Purpose**: Main container component for displaying the certificates list
- **Features**:
  - Displays list of certificates using CertificateItem components
  - Shows empty state when no certificates exist
  - Contains "Add Certificate" button
  - Scrollable container with custom scrollbar styling

### CertificateItem.jsx
- **Purpose**: Individual certificate display component
- **Features**:
  - Shows certificate name, issuing organization, and issue date
  - Displays credential URL as a clickable link (if provided)
  - Edit and Delete action buttons
  - Consistent styling with ITI color scheme
  - Hover effects and transitions

### CertificateForm.jsx
- **Purpose**: Form component for adding/editing certificates
- **Features**:
  - Form validation for required fields
  - URL validation for credential links
  - Error handling and display
  - Consistent styling with other forms
  - Support for both add and edit modes

## Modal Integration
- Uses the shared Modal component with React Portal for full-screen overlay
- No Framer Motion animations to prevent conflicts
- Proper scroll locking when modal is open
- Keyboard navigation support (ESC to close)

## Usage in SkillsAndCertificatesForm.js
The main form now uses these modular components with:
- State management for modal visibility and editing mode
- Proper data flow between components
- Consistent error handling
- Integration with existing achievements system

## Benefits
1. **Modularity**: Each component has a single responsibility
2. **Reusability**: Components can be easily reused or extended
3. **Maintainability**: Easier to update and debug individual components
4. **Consistency**: Follows the same pattern as Education and Experience sections
5. **User Experience**: Modal-based editing provides better UX
